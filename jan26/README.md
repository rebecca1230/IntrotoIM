# Frist Assignment

![](/jan26/screenshot2.png)

## Difficulties: 
1. I was spending a lot of time working on creating hair one by one using the curve function, which after the assignment, I understand the importance of first planning the simplest way to do the most work rather than dive into working right away. 
2. Finding the right angle for the nose was difficult.  

## Discovery: 
1. Use the "int" function is more efficient than adjusting the numbers one by one. 
2. Using a notebook to first draw out and understand the relationship between different points is really beneficial.
