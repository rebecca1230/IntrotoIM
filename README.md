# IntrotoIM
## This is smaller 
### much smaller 
#### and so on
*this should be in italic*
**this should be bold**
this is a sentence 
in the same paragraph 
that will still join together 
even though we hit enter
because of how github is designed

however, if we leave a space line, we will have a new paragraph. 

(remember to leave space after # in order for it to work :) )

## Class note (for now)
1. triangle (150, 150, 20, 20, 70, 30) : triangle is the function and the numbers are the arguments to it. 
2. order matters. 
3. use result of one function as an information to the other function.
4. For Processing: space, enter a line of space, joint info, all don't affect the programming. 
5. random(255) means "give me a number between 0 and 255". Random only allows float and not int. 
6. size[an exception] and width goes together. Size's order does not matter, and its value applies to width in all locations.
println: go ahead to print this, but create a seperate line.
