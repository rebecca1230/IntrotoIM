# IntrotoIM
## This is smaller 
### much smaller 
#### and so on
*this should be in italic*
**this should be bold**
this is a sentence 
in the same paragraph 
that will still join together 
even though we hit enter
because of how github is designed

however, if we leave a space line, we will have a new paragraph. 

(remember to leave space after # in order for it to work :) )

## Class note (for now)
1. triangle (150, 150, 20, 20, 70, 30) : triangle is the function and the numbers are the arguments to it. 
2. order matters. 
3. use result of one function as an information to the other function.
