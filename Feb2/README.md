## Second Assignment: Create an art with loops 
### Difficulties
### Discovery: mousePressed and mouseReleased
Though at the end did not apply those functions into the programming, I discovered something worth investigate more.
I've been experimenting on the two functions and realise that the differences are subtle. I tried to use a for loop that changes the background of the art with mousePressed and mouseReleased. However, I notice that mousePressed can be inserted under a void whereas mouseReleased can not.
